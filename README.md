# book-search-engine

I started this project and was given a fully completed Rest API book-search engine and I changed it into a GraphQL API. I learned a lot about GraphQL and also had to fully understand the REST API to convert it successfully. I also learned how to use ApolloServer to create my Queries and Mutations easily.
